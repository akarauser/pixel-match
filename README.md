Image Search

This script implements a Streamlit application for image similarity search using a pre-trained image model. The application loads an image dataset, generates embeddings for each image, and then allows users to upload an image for similarity searching. The code employs efficient data loading and embedding generation techniques, along with session state management for managing application state. Key improvements include robust error handling and a focus on creating an intuitive user interface.
